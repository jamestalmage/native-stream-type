> Find the native stream type, validate it for child_process use

The [`stdio` option in `child_process.spawn`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v6.x/docs/api/child_process.html#child_process_options_stdio) allows only certain types of streams. You can use this module to determine if an object is an allowed stream type.

You can use this module to validate stream arguments before passing to `child_process`.


## Install

```
$ npm install --save native-stream-type
```


## Usage

```js
const nativeStreamType = require('native-stream-type');

nativeStreamType(process.stdin);
//=> 'tty'
```


## API

### nativeStreamType(obj)

Returns a `string` (`pipe` | `tty` | `tcp` | `udp`) if `obj` is one of the native backed stream implementations. 
Returns `false` if `obj` is not one of the above native streams.

Note that `udp` sockets don't necessarily implement a stream interface (see "Notes" section below).

#### obj

Type: `Stream`

An object that might be a native stream implementation.


## Notes

This uses the undocumented `process.binding(...)`. At present, the Node team is avoiding deprecation, as it is very widely used despite being undocumented.

You are allowed to pass UDP sockets to the `stdio` option, but they don't seam to implement the stream interface. If you want to guarantee the object is also a stream, you should use this in combination with [`is-stream`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/is-stream). I have yet to find a good example of udp sockets being passed to `spawn`. It works without throwing an error, but I can't get the socket to transfer any data to the child process.
